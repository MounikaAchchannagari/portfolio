Through comprehensive SQL analysis, I uncovered significant insights into rental rates, revenue trends, and customer engagement metrics. By identifying the top countries and cities based on customer base and revenue in 2006, recognizing loyal customers, and determining popular film genres, I provided valuable recommendations for pricing optimization, market expansion, and loyalty initiatives. These insights are poised to bolster Rockbuster Stealth's online presence and drive sustained growth in the competitive video rental market. </p>
